    "text": "In this blog post, I train a logisitc regression model to predict employment status using a variety of demographic features excluding race, and then I perform a fairness audit to assess whether the model displays racial bias. All data I use is from the American Community Survey. My blog post contains some initial basic exploration of the data, followed by model training, a fairness audit and some concluding discussion.\n\n\nFor this blog post, I chose to examine racial bias in an employment status prediction model. I looked specifically at data from the state of Delaware, as this is where I am from. I trained my model on the list of features suggested in the blog post assignment, which include sex, age, level of schooling, disability status, and nativity, among other features. All features used are explained in detail in the appendix of Ding et al. After choosing my problem, I downloaded the data extracted relevant features and cleaned it up to prepare for training, and then performed a train/test split.\n\nfrom folktables import ACSDataSource, ACSEmployment, BasicProblem, adult_filter\nimport numpy as np\n\n# download data\nSTATE = \"DE\"\n\ndata_source = ACSDataSource(survey_year='2018', \n                            horizon='1-Year', \n                            survey='person')\n\nacs_data = data_source.get_data(states=[STATE], download=True)\n\n# extract relevant features\npossible_features=['AGEP', 'SCHL', 'MAR', 'RELP', 'DIS', 'ESP', 'CIT', 'MIG', 'MIL', 'ANC', 'NATIVITY', 'DEAR', 'DEYE', 'DREM', 'SEX', 'RAC1P', 'ESR']\nacs_data[possible_features].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      AGEP\n      SCHL\n      MAR\n      RELP\n      DIS\n      ESP\n      CIT\n      MIG\n      MIL\n      ANC\n      NATIVITY\n      DEAR\n      DEYE\n      DREM\n      SEX\n      RAC1P\n      ESR\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      38\n      14.0\n      5\n      16\n      2\n      NaN\n      1\n      1.0\n      4.0\n      8\n      1\n      2\n      2\n      2.0\n      1\n      2\n      6.0\n    \n    \n      1\n      87\n      19.0\n      2\n      16\n      1\n      NaN\n      1\n      1.0\n      4.0\n      8\n      1\n      2\n      2\n      1.0\n      1\n      1\n      6.0\n    \n    \n      2\n      18\n      18.0\n      5\n      17\n      2\n      NaN\n      1\n      1.0\n      4.0\n      8\n      1\n      2\n      2\n      2.0\n      2\n      1\n      6.0\n    \n    \n      3\n      20\n      19.0\n      5\n      17\n      2\n      NaN\n      1\n      1.0\n      4.0\n      2\n      1\n      2\n      2\n      2.0\n      2\n      2\n      6.0\n    \n    \n      4\n      83\n      13.0\n      2\n      16\n      1\n      NaN\n      1\n      1.0\n      2.0\n      8\n      1\n      2\n      2\n      2.0\n      1\n      1\n      6.0\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n# remove race and employment status from the training features\nfeatures_to_use = [f for f in possible_features if f not in [\"ESR\", \"RAC1P\"]]\n\n\n# construct basic problem\nEmploymentProblem = BasicProblem(\n    features=features_to_use,\n    target='ESR',\n    target_transform=lambda x: x == 1,\n    group='RAC1P',\n    preprocess=lambda x: x,\n    postprocess=lambda x: np.nan_to_num(x, -1),\n)\n\nfeatures, label, group = EmploymentProblem.df_to_numpy(acs_data)\n\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, group_train, group_test = train_test_split(\n    features, label, group, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve defined a problem, let’s do some basic descriptive analysis.

We see that there are 5535 White individuals, 1168 Black/African American individuals, and 595 individuals of other self-identified racial groups. The largest racial group in the dataset by far is White individuals.\n\ndf.groupby(\"group\").size()\n\ngroup\n1    5535\n2    1168\n3      26\n5      10\n6     267\n7       2\n8     120\n9     170\ndtype: int64\n\n\nIf we look at employment rate by race, we see an employment rate of 0.46 for White individuals and an employment rate of 0.44 for Black/African American individuals.\n\ndf.groupby(\"group\")[[\"label\"]].mean()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      label\n    \n    \n      group\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1\n      0.462511\n    \n    \n      2\n      0.443493\n    \n    \n      3\n      0.461538\n    \n    \n      5\n      0.300000\n    \n    \n      6\n      0.494382\n    \n    \n      7\n      1.000000\n    \n    \n      8\n      0.433333\n    \n    \n      9\n      0.358824\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nWe can break this down further to look at differences in employment rate by both race and sex. We see higher employment rates for White males, compared with White females. Conversely, we see that Black females have higher employment rates than Black males. The gap between male and female employment rates is 5-6% for both racial groups.\n\ndf.groupby([\"group\",\"SEX\"])[[\"label\"]].mean()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      label\n    \n    \n      group\n      SEX\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1\n      1.0\n      0.490064\n    \n    \n      2.0\n      0.436890\n    \n    \n      2\n      1.0\n      0.411654\n    \n    \n      2.0\n      0.470126\n    \n    \n      3\n      1.0\n      0.428571\n    \n    \n      2.0\n      0.500000\n    \n    \n      5\n      1.0\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      2.0\n      0.500000\n    \n    \n      6\n      1.0\n      0.532258\n    \n    \n      2.0\n      0.461538\n    \n    \n      7\n      1.0\n      1.000000\n    \n    \n      8\n      1.0\n      0.524590\n    \n    \n      2.0\n      0.338983\n    \n    \n      9\n      1.0\n      0.362637\n    \n    \n      2.0\n      0.354430\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nWe can also visualize these trends using a barchart. From the barchart, we can see that there are not particularly large disparities in employment rate by gender for the different races, except for groups 5 and 7, which appear to only have data on females and males, respectively.\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nmeans = df.groupby([\"group\", \"SEX\"])[\"label\"].mean().reset_index(name = \"mean\")\nsns.barplot(data = means, x = \"group\", y = \"mean\", hue = \"SEX\")\n\n<AxesSubplot: xlabel='group', ylabel='mean'>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter doing some basic exploration of the data, it is now time for us to choose and train a model. We’ll train a logistic regression model, but we’ll tune the polynomial features parameter using our training data before testing our model.\n\n# utilized code from \"Introduction to Classification in

We get an accuracy of 0.81. This is relatively good, but I would not want to release a tool into the real-world with an accuracy this low. It could be worth exploring other models or feature combinations for training a different model in the future.\n\nplr.score(X_test, y_test).round(4)\n\n0.8121\n\n\nNext let’s calculate positive predictive value (PPV) as well as false negative and false positive rates. To do this, we’ll extract our model’s predictions and construct a normalized confusion matrix.\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n\ny_pred = plr.predict(X_test)\nconf = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred, normalize = \"true\")\nconf\n\narray([[0.78817734, 0.21182266],\n       [0.15802469, 0.84197531]])\n\n\n\nFPR = conf[0,1]\nFNR = conf[1,0]\nPPV = conf[1,1]/np.sum(conf[:,1])\n\nprint(\"FPR: \", FPR)\nprint(\"FNR: \", FNR)\nprint(\"PPV: \", PPV)\n\nFPR:  0.21182266009852216\nFNR:  0.1580246913580247\nPPV:  0.7989912047831206\n\n\nWe see a PPV of 0.799, meaning that approximately 80% of the individuals that our model predicted were employed are actually employed. We see relatively low FPR and FNR, with the false positive rate about 30% higher than the false negative rate. This means our model overpredicts employed status - we are more likely to predict an unemployed person is employed, rather than predicting that an employed person is unemployed.\n\n\n\nNow let’s break things down by race, focusing specifically on the White and Black/African American groups. Looking at overall accuracy, we see that the accuracy for White indiciduals is slightly higher than Black/African American individuals, by about 3%.\n\ndf_test = pd.DataFrame(X_test, columns = features_to_use)\ndf_test[\"group\"] = group_test\ndf_test[\"label\"] = y_test\n\nblack_ix = df_test[\"group\"] == 2\nwhite_ix = df_test[\"group\"] == 1\n\ncorrect_pred = y_pred == df_test[\"label\"]\n\n# accuracy on Black defendants\naccuracy_black = correct_pred[black_ix].mean()\n\n# accuracy on white defendants\naccuracy_white = correct_pred[white_ix].mean()\n\nprint(\"White accuracy: \", accuracy_white)\nprint(\"Black accuracy: \", accuracy_black)\n\nWhite accuracy:  0.817117776152158\nBlack accuracy:  0.7911392405063291\n\n\n\nblack_conf = confusion_matrix(df_test[\"label\"][black_ix], \n                 y_pred[black_ix],\n                 normalize = \"true\")\nblack_conf\n\narray([[0.75621891, 0.24378109],\n       [0.14782609, 0.85217391]])\n\n\nNext we’ll break down PPV, FPR and FNR by group. We see that false positive rates are higher than false negative rates across both groups, but the gap between FPR and FNR is much larger for Black individuals (10% versus 4%).\n\nblack_FPR = black_conf[0,1]\nblack_FNR = black_conf[1,0]\nblack_PPV = black_conf[1,1]/np.sum(black_conf[:,1])\n\nprint(\"FPR: \", black_FPR)\nprint(\"FNR: \", black_FNR)\nprint(\"PPV: \", black_PPV)\n\nFPR:  0.24378109452736318\nFNR:  0.14782608695652175\nPPV:  0.7775628626692457\n\n\n\nwhite_conf = confusion_matrix(df_test[\"label\"][white_ix], \n                 y_pred[white_ix],\n                 normalize = \"true\")\nwhite_conf\n\narray([[0.79753762, 0.20246238],\n       [0.16037736, 0.83962264]])\n\n\n\nwhite_FPR = white_conf[0,1]\nwhite_FNR = white_conf[1,0]\nwhite_PPV = white_conf[1,1]/np.sum(white_conf[:,1])\n\nprint(\"FPR: \", white_FPR)\nprint(\"FNR: \", white_FNR)\nprint(\"PPV: \", white_PPV)\n\nFPR:  0.2024623803009576\nFNR:  0.16037735849056603\nPPV:  0.8057141441787311\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we’ll examine some specific bias measures. First let’s check if our model is well calibrated. To do this, we’ll check if the fraction predicted employed people who are actually employed is the same across groups. Of those predicted employed, slightly more White than black individuals were actually employed, but the rates are relatively consistent across groups.\n\ndf_test[\"pred\"] = y_pred\ndf_test = df_test[white_ix|black_ix]\n\nmeans = df_test.groupby([\"group\", \"pred\"])[\"label\"].mean().reset_index(name = \"mean\")\n\np = sns.barplot(data = means, x = \"pred\", y = \"mean\", hue = \"group\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine error rate balance, we’ll check if FPR and FNR are consistent across both groups. We already calculated false positive and false negative rates by group above, and we can see that they differ slightly, but not substantially. We can plot these trends also to visualize them better. False negative rates are pretty consistent across the two groups, but the false positive rate for Black/African-American individuals is higher than for White individuals.\n\nrate_type = [\"FPR\", \"FNR\", \"FPR\", \"FNR\"]\ngroup = [\"Black\", \"Black\", \"White\", \"White\"]\nrate = [black_FPR, black_FNR, white_FPR, white_FNR]\n\nrates_df = pd.DataFrame(list(zip(rate_type, group, rate)), columns=['rate_type', 'group', 'rate'])\n\nmeans = rates_df.groupby([\"group\",\"rate_type\"])[\"rate\"].sum().reset_index(name = \"rate\")\np = sns.barplot(data = means, x = \"rate_type\", y = \"rate\", hue = \"group\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo calculate statistical parity, we check if the proportion of individuals classified as employed is the same across groups. While the rates differ slightly, they are close enough that we can probably say statistical parity is satisfied.\n\nmeans = df_test.groupby(\"group\")[\"pred\"].mean().reset_index(name = \"proportion classified employed\")\nprint(means)\n\np = sns.barplot(data = means, x = \"group\", y = \"proportion classified employed\")\n\n   group  proportion classified employed\n0      1                        0.498903\n1      2                        0.465190\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn employment prediction tool such as the model trained here could be useful for a variety of companies. For example, companies trying to recruit employees could use an employment prediction tool to find unemployed people to target for recruiting. Employment is also often used as a proxy for wealth/financial stability, so people trying to assess someone’s financial stability, such as a bank considering someone for a loan or a landlord considering someone for a lease might use an employment prediction tool when evaluating them. This could negatively impact people who were predicted as unemployed, particularly if they actually were employed, preventing them from needed opportunities for financial growth. Based on my bias audit, White individuals are more often predicted as employed than Black individuals. However, White individuals are less likely to be falsely predicted as employed than Black people are, while White people are slightly more likely to be falsely predicted as unemployed than Black people are. Thus, if my model was used as an employment prediction tool by banks, landlords, etc., it would probably approve slightly more White people for loans and leases than Black people. This could reinforce existing societal biases within the US which give White people more access to capital and opportunities for financial growth. On the other hand, the higher FPR for Black individuals could allow unemployed Black people to still have access to new sources of capital, housing, etc. If used as a recruiting tool, the higher FPR for Black individuals would intorduce additional hurdles for raising the employment rate among Black people because recruitment efforts would be more likely to be targeted towards White people.\nBased on my audit, I do not think that my model shows significant problematic bias. The model is relatively well-calibrated for race and it satisfies statistical parity. The one area where the model appears to be a bit biased is in error rate balance, specifically with regard to false positive rates. It is surprising to me that the FPR is higher for Black people than White people, as it is contrary to existing societal biases. While more balanced false positive rates would be preferred, a difference in 4% does not seem too problematic. Additionally, I think that it is better for this model to have inflated false positive rates, rather than false negative rates, as false positive rates would give people more opportunities to accrue capital, rather than less. Despite the model not showing much racial bias, I still do not think that employment prediction tools should be used. If a person is not required to divulge their employment status for a certain application process, then I do not think that their assumed employment status should be allowed to be considered. While employment prediction tools could be helpful for recruiting purposes, I think they are likely to do more harm than good in gatekeeping people from access to housing, money, and other living needs. I do not see enough positive uses for these tools that outweigh the potential negative impacts, so I think that their use should be banned."

    "section": "Implementing Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent",
    "text": "Implementing Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent\nImplementing logistic loss with gradient descent does not differ hugely from implementing the perceptron algorithm, which I do in my last blog post. Both algorithms follow a similar formula of intializing random weights, and iteratively performing weight updates and calculating loss until the algorithm converges (or max iterations are performed). The main differences are the way that the weight update is performed and the function used to calculate loss. In this implementation, the weights are updated by calculating the gradient of the loss function with current weights, and then multiplying this by a specified learning rate and subtracting it from the current weights. Gradient descent converges when the gradient is zero, meaning a local minimum is found, and the loss stops updating. In this case, logistic loss was used. Logistic loss was chosen because it is a convex function, which means that we can treat local minima as global minima, making it easier to solve for the optimal weights. To train our logistic regression model, we follow a similar pattern of fitting the model to training data and calculating accuracy and loss as we train to see if the model is learning successfully.\n\nTesting the logistic regression model\nTo train and experiment on our model we must first create some data. Here we create data that is not quite linearly separable, but is relatively close.\n\nfrom logistic import LogisticRegression # your source code\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nnp.seterr(all='ignore') \n\n# make the data\np_features = 3\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 200, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1, -1), (1, 1)])\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\n\n\n\nAfter creating and visualizing some data, we fit it and visualize the loss and accuracy overtime.\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit(X, y, .5, 1000)\n\nnum_steps = len(LR.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.loss_history, label = \"loss\")\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.score_history, label = \"accuracy\")\n\nplt.loglog()\n\nlegend = plt.legend()\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Epochs\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Loss/Accuracy\")\n\n\n\n\nWe see that as the loss decreases, the accuracy increases, which makes sense. If we run the model numerous times, we see that the amount of time it takes for the model to converge varies, which is largely a result of the initial random weight chosen.\n\ndef draw_line(w, x_min, x_max):\n  x = np.linspace(x_min, x_max, 101)\n  y = -(w[0]*x + w[2])/w[1]\n  plt.plot(x, y, color = \"black\")\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nfig = draw_line(LR.w, -2, 2)\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\nplt.ylim([-3,3])\n\n(-3.0, 3.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLR.score_history[-1]\n\n0.94\n\n\nIf we visualize the line drawn by our final weights, we see that it does a very good job of classifying our data. When we print the final accuracy we get 0.94, which seems reasonable for data that is not linearly separable. If we run these cells several times, we see the same line drawn each time, even if the evolution of the loss and accuracy looks different. This suggests that our logistic regression algorithm is always converging to the global minima, even if it doesn’t always take the same amount of time.\n\n\nChanging the learning rate\nWe can alter values of alpha, the learning rate, to make our algorithm converge more quickly. However, if we make our learning rate too large, our algorithm will never converge because it will jump over the minima each time it makes an update. To see this, lets set our learning rate to 50.\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit(X, y, 50, 1000)\n\nnum_steps = len(LR.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.loss_history)\n#plt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.score_history, label = \"accuracy\")\n\nplt.loglog()\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Epochs\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Loss\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that when we do this, the algorithm never converges, but instead the loss bounces around between approximately 0.38 and 0.39 loss between epochs 100 and 1000.\n\n\nLogistic regression with stochastic gradient descent\nNext we implement logistic regression with stochastic gradient descent. This function uses the same principal of gradient descent, but it splits the data into batches and performs a weight update for each batch before updating the loss and score. By performing multiple updates within each epoch, the algorithm will likely converge more quickly.\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\n\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, .01, 1000, 10)\n\nnum_steps = len(LR.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.loss_history)\n#plt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.score_history, label = \"accuracy\")\n\nplt.loglog()\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Epochs\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Loss\")\n\n\n\n\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nfig = draw_line(LR.w, -2, 2)\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\nplt.ylim([-3,3])\n\n(-3.0, 3.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLR.score_history[-1]\n\n0.935\n\n\nOur stochastic algorithm also draws the same line, although we need to use a smaller learning rate to allow the algorithm to converge, and we see small fluctuations at higher epochs.\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, \n                  max_epochs = 1000, \n                  batch_size = 10, \n                  alpha = .05)\n\nnum_steps = len(LR.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.loss_history, label = \"stochastic gradient\")\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nLR.fit(X, y, alpha = .05, max_epochs = 1000)\n\nnum_steps = len(LR.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.loss_history, label = \"gradient\")\n\nplt.loglog()\n\nlegend = plt.legend()\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Epochs\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Loss\")\n\n\n\n\nWhen we compare the stochastic versus regular gradient descent, we can see that the stochastic loss decreases more quickly at the beginning, but we see small fluctuations in loss at later timesteps.\nNow lets compare a series of batch sizes and see how it affects how quickly the algorithm converges.\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\n\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, .01, 100, 10)\n\nnum_steps = len(LR.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.loss_history, label = \"batch size = 10\")\n#plt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.score_history, label = \"accuracy\")\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\n\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, .01, 100, 20)\n\nnum_steps = len(LR.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.loss_history, label = \"batch size = 20\")\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\n\nLR.fit_stochastic(X, y, .01, 100, 50)\n\nnum_steps = len(LR.loss_history)\nplt.plot(np.arange(num_steps) + 1, LR.loss_history, label = \"batch size = 50\")\n\nplt.loglog()\n\nlegend = plt.legend()\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Epochs\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Loss\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that as we increase the batch size, the algorithm takes longer to converge. This makes sense, as the power of stochastic gradient descent lies in performing several updates within each epoch. As we increase the batch size, we decrease the number of updates performed in each epoch, requiring more epochs for the algorithm to converge."

    "text": "Implementing Linear Regression\nIn this blog post I implement linear regression in two ways: analytically, using an equation that solves for the optimal model weights, and using gradient descent, similar to the methods used in my prior logistic regression blog post. The implementation of linear regression is similar to logistic regression, but rather than calculating binary labels for a given data point, it calculates a specific value based on a data point’s features. This is what differentiates regression tasks (predicting a number) from classification tasks (predicting a label). To calculate optimal weights analytically, the following formula was used (taken from lecture notes): \\[\\mathbf{\\hat{w}}=\\mathbf{(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty}.\\] When implementing linear regression with gradient descent, the gradient was calculated with (from blog assignment description): \\[\\mathbf{\\nabla L(w)}=\\mathbf{X^T(Xw-y)},\\] and used to perform weight updates as done when using gradient descent for logistic regression. Both methods produced the same weights and were able to achieve relatively high accuracies on training and validation data. Experiments were done to analyze overfitting as the number of features were increased, and LASSO regularization was employed to minimize overfitting with increasing features. Lastly, I use my linear regression model to predict trends in casual bikeshare usage in Washington DC, finding that my model is able to learn trends in bikeshare usage relatively well.\n\nTesting Two Implementations\nBefore testing my two fitting techniques, I have to generate some data. I have generated both training and validation data, visualized below. We can see the two datasets exhibit similar trends, so my model trained on the training data, should generalize to the validation data relatively well.\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\ndef pad(X):\n    return np.append(X, np.ones((X.shape[0], 1)), 1)\n\ndef LR_data(n_train = 100, n_val = 100, p_features = 1, noise = .1, w = None):\n    if w is None: \n        w = np.random.rand(p_features + 1) + .2\n    \n    X_train = np.random.rand(n_train, p_features)\n    y_train = pad(X_train)@w + noise*np.random.randn(n_train)\n\n    X_val = np.random.rand(n_val, p_features)\n    y_val = pad(X_val)@w + noise*np.random.randn(n_val)\n    \n    return X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val\n\n\nn_train = 100\nn_val = 100\np_features = 1\nnoise = 0.2\n\n# create some data\nX_train, y_train, X_val, y_val = LR_data(n_train, n_val, p_features, noise)\n\n# plot it\nfig, axarr = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharex = True, sharey = True)\naxarr[0].scatter(X_train, y_train)\naxarr[1].scatter(X_val, y_val)\nlabs = axarr[0].set(title = \"Training\", xlabel = \"x\", ylabel = \"y\")\nlabs = axarr[1].set(title = \"Validation\", xlabel = \"x\")\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\nNext I import the model and test it, first fitting the data using the analytical technique desribed above. When we print the accuracies, we see a training score of 0.59 and a validation score of 0.62. The model actually performs better on the validation data! This is encouraging, as it means we are likely not overfitting.\n\nfrom linear_regression import LinearRegression\n\nLR = LinearRegression()\nLR.fit(X_train, y_train) # I used the analytical formula as my default fit method\n\nprint(f\"Training score = {LR.score(X_train, y_train).round(4)}\")\nprint(f\"Validation score = {LR.score(X_val, y_val).round(4)}\")\n\nTraining score = 0.5944\nValidation score = 0.6242\n\n\nWe can visualize the results of our model, and we see that it does a good job of drawing a line that reflects trends in the data.\n\n# plot it\nfig, axarr = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharex = True, sharey = True)\naxarr[0].scatter(X_train, y_train)\naxarr[0].plot(X_train, LR.predict(X_train), color = \"black\")\naxarr[1].scatter(X_val, y_val)\naxarr[1].plot(X_val, LR.predict(X_val), color = \"black\")\nlabs = axarr[0].set(title = \"Training\", xlabel = \"x\", ylabel = \"y\")\nlabs = axarr[1].set(title = \"Validation\", xlabel = \"x\")\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\nWhen we print the weights of the model fit using analytical methods and compare it to the model weights when using gradient descent, we see that we get the same weights, as we would expect. If we trained the gradient descent model on more epochs, we would likely see even more agreement in the later decimal places.\n\nLR.w\n\narray([1.09501024, 0.88755776])\n\n\n\nLR2 = LinearRegression()\n\nLR2.fit(X_train, y_train, method = \"gradient\", alpha = 0.01, max_epochs = 1e2)\nLR2.w\n\narray([1.09428466, 0.88794095])\n\n\nWe can also plot the score history of the gradient descent model and we see an initial steep increase in the score, as expected, before plateauing around 0.7 after about 20 iterations.\n\nplt.plot(LR2.score_history)\nlabels = plt.gca().set(xlabel = \"Iteration\", ylabel = \"Score\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimenting with Number of Features\nNext we increase the number of features and see how this impacts model performance on both training and validation data. We see that as we increase the number of features, the training score also increases before plateauing around 1.0, the highest possible value. The validation score initially increases as well, but then sharply declines to values below zero, indicating very poor performance, as the number of features approaches the number of data points. This is due to overfitting. As we increase the number of features to get closer to the number of data points, the model has a difficult time generalizing and extracting patterns because there is not enough data. This negatively impacts the validation score because rather than extracting general patterns, the model simply learns the exact behavior of the training dataset.\n\nn_train = 100\nn_val = 100\nnoise = 0.2\n\ntrain_scores = []\nval_scores = []\nLR3 = LinearRegression()\n\nfor i in range(1,n_train):\n    p_features = i\n    X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val = LR_data(n_train, n_val, p_features, noise)\n    LR3.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    train_scores.append(LR3.score(X_train, y_train).round(4))\n    val_scores.append(LR3.score(X_val, y_val).round(4))\n    \nplt.plot(np.arange(1,n_train),train_scores, label = \"training\")\nplt.plot(np.arange(1,n_train),val_scores, label = \"validation\")\n\nlabels = plt.gca().set(xlabel = \"Num features\", ylabel = \"Score\")\n\nlegend = plt.legend()\n\n\n\n\nTo combat this, we utilize LASSO regularization. LASSO regularization constrains the weight vector to be small, forcing many weights to be zero. This minimizes the effects of overfitting because it constrains the number of features that actually contribute to the model’s final predictions. When we employ LASSO regularization with an alpha of 0.001 we see a dip in later validation scores, but it is much smaller, dipping from about 1.0 to 0.8, rather than falling to almost -0.75.\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Lasso\n\nn_train = 100\nn_val = 100\nnoise = 0.2\n\ntrain_scores = []\nval_scores = []\nL = Lasso(alpha = 0.001)\n\nfor i in range(1,n_train):\n    p_features = i\n    X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val = LR_data(n_train, n_val, p_features, noise)\n    L.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    train_scores.append(L.score(X_train, y_train).round(4))\n    val_scores.append(L.score(X_val, y_val).round(4))\n    \nplt.plot(np.arange(1,n_train),train_scores, label = \"training\")\nplt.plot(np.arange(1,n_train),val_scores, label = \"validation\")\n\nlabels = plt.gca().set(xlabel = \"Num features\", ylabel = \"Score\")\n\nlegend = plt.legend()\n\n\n\n\nExperimenting with different alpha values, we see that when we increase alpha to 0.01 the score dips further. When we decrease alpha to 0.0001, we see similar behavior to our original alpha value of 0.001, with a slightly smaller dip.\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Lasso\n\nn_train = 100\nn_val = 100\nnoise = 0.2\n\ntrain_scores = []\nval_scores = []\nL = Lasso(alpha = 0.01)\n\nfor i in range(1,n_train):\n    p_features = i\n    X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val = LR_data(n_train, n_val, p_features, noise)\n    L.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    train_scores.append(L.score(X_train, y_train).round(4))\n    val_scores.append(L.score(X_val, y_val).round(4))\n    \nplt.plot(np.arange(1,n_train),train_scores, label = \"training\")\nplt.plot(np.arange(1,n_train),val_scores, label = \"validation\")\n\nlabels = plt.gca().set(xlabel = \"Num features\", ylabel = \"Score\")\n\nlegend = plt.legend()\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Lasso\n\nn_train = 100\nn_val = 100\nnoise = 0.2\n\ntrain_scores = []\nval_scores = []\nL = Lasso(alpha = 0.0001)\n\nfor i in range(1,n_train):\n    p_features = i\n    X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val = LR_data(n_train, n_val, p_features, noise)\n    L.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    train_scores.append(L.score(X_train, y_train).round(4))\n    val_scores.append(L.score(X_val, y_val).round(4))\n    \nplt.plot(np.arange(1,n_train),train_scores, label = \"training\")\nplt.plot(np.arange(1,n_train),val_scores, label = \"validation\")\n\nlabels = plt.gca().set(xlabel = \"Num features\", ylabel = \"Score\")\n\nlegend = plt.legend()\n\n/Users/elizawieman/opt/anaconda3/envs/ml-0451/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/linear_model/_coordinate_descent.py:631: ConvergenceWarning: Objective did not converge.

We see that our model is able to reproduce the general trends in casual usage, although tends to predict smaller fluctuations in usage (lower maxima, higher minima) than the actual data shows.\n\nLR4 = LinearRegression()\n\nLR4.fit(X_train, y_train)\nLR4.score(X_test, y_test)\n\ny_pred = LR4.predict(X_test)\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize = (7, 3))\nax.plot(np.arange(len(y_test)), y_test, label=\"test\")\nax.plot(np.arange(len(y_test)), y_pred, label=\"pred\")\nax.set(xlabel = \"Day\", ylabel = \"# of casual users\")\nl = plt.tight_layout()\n\nlegend = plt.legend()\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can examine which factors the model considers to be contributing the most to usage. The highest weight in our model contributes to the variable temperature, meaning that our model considers temperature to be a very important factor in determining casual bike usage. This makes sense, as people would probably be more likely to ride a bike on a warmer day. The weight corresponding to windspeed is the most negative value by far. This also makes sense, as a high windspeed would likely discourage people from wanting to bike outside. We also see trends by month, with higher weights attributed to the spring and fall months, some of the nicest bike weather, and lower weights attributed to summer and winter months, when it could be to hot or cold to ride comfortably. We also see that people are less likely to use bikeshares on working days and holidays, suggesting that much of the casual bikeshare usage happens on the weekends.\n\nprint(LR4.w)\nprint(X_train.columns)\n\n[ -108.37113627  -791.69054913   280.58692733  1498.71511272\n  -490.10033978 -1242.80038075  -235.87934918    -3.35439712\n   369.27195552   518.40875345   537.30188616   360.80799815\n   228.88148125   241.31641202   371.50385387   437.60084787\n   252.43300405    90.8214605    919.07676215]\nIndex(['weathersit', 'workingday', 'yr', 'temp', 'hum', 'windspeed', 'holiday',\n       'mnth_2', 'mnth_3', 'mnth_4', 'mnth_5', 'mnth_6', 'mnth_7', 'mnth_8',\n       'mnth_9', 'mnth_10', 'mnth_11', 'mnth_12'],\n      dtype='object')"

    "text": "Implementing Perceptron\nThe perceptron update was implemented using: \\[\\mathbf{\\tilde{w}}^{(t+1)}=\\mathbf{\\tilde{w}}^{(t)}+\\mathbb{1}(y_i\\langle\\mathbf{\\tilde{w}}^{(t)}\\mathbf{,\\tilde{x}}_i\\rangle<0)y_i\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_i\\] (Equation 1 in https://middlebury-csci-0451.github.io/CSCI-0451/assignments/blog-posts/blog-post-perceptron.html#source-code). This update works by calculating the dot product of the current weights and the features of the selected point and then multiplying it by the true label of that point. If the signs of the dot product and the label are different then the weights are updated, otherwise the weights remain the same. In the case that an update does occur, the new weights are calculated by multiplying the features of the selected point by the actual label and adding that to the current weights. Since we multiply the selected points features’ by the point’s true label, we are always moving our weights in the direction of that label, improving the perceptron’s ability to classify that specific point. By iterating through the points randomly and performing updates, the perceptron algorithm eventually converges if the data is linearly separable."

    "text": "Testing the Algorithm\nThree experiments were performed to verify that the perceptron algorithm was implemented correctly.\n\nExperiment 1: Linearly Separable Data\nFirst the perceptron was fit on linearly separable data with two features.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\nfrom perceptron import Perceptron\n\n100 data points were generated, each with two features and a label of 1 or 0. The data was designed to be linearly separable (meaning the perceptron should converge if run for long enough).\n\nnp.random.seed(12345)\n\nn = 100\np_features = 3\n\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 100, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1.7, -1.7), (1.7, 1.7)])\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithm was fit to the data with a maximum of 1000 iterations.\n\np = Perceptron()\np.fit(X, y, max_steps = 1000)\n\nIf we print the weight vector, we see three values. The first value is the weight of feature 1, the second is the weight of feature 2, and the third is the bias.\n\np.w\n\narray([2.10557404, 3.1165449 , 0.25079936])\n\n\nWe can also plot the accuracy as the model is fit.\n\nfig = plt.plot(p.history)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Iteration\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Accuracy\")\n\n\n\n\nIf we print the accuracy, we see that it is 1.0, we classified all of our data correctly!\n\np.score(X, y)\n\n1.0\n\n\nWe see this too when we draw the line specified by our weights. The line perfectly separates the two types of data.\n\ndef draw_line(w, x_min, x_max):\n  x = np.linspace(x_min, x_max, 101)\n  y = -(w[0]*x + w[2])/w[1]\n  plt.plot(x, y, color = \"black\")\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nfig = draw_line(p.w, -2, 2)\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\nplt.ylim([-4,4])\n\n(-4.0, 4.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 2: Not Linearly Separable Data\nNext let’s see how our algorithm runs on data that isn’t linearly separable. First we’ll define some new data. We still have 100 points, each with two features and a label, but when we visualize the data below we can see that it is not clustered as nicely.\n\nnp.random.seed(123)\n\np_features = 3\n\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 100, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1, -1), (1, 1)])\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\n\n\n\nA new perceptron was fit and the weights were printed. Like with Experiment 1, we see a weight vector with three values.\n\np2 = Perceptron()\np2.fit(X, y, max_steps = 1000)\np2.w\n\narray([ 3.25206473,  1.64360407, -1.10792451])\n\n\nWhen we plot and print the accuracy over time, we see that we were able to achieve an accuracy of 0.89 after 1000 runs. This makes sense, as an accuracy of 1.0 is required for the algorithm to end early, which is impossible on this dataset.\n\nfig = plt.plot(p2.history)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Iteration\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Accuracy\")\n\n\n\n\n\np2.score(X,y)\n\n0.89\n\n\nWhen we visualize the line that the perceptron specified, we see that it’s pretty good. It seems unlikely that the accuracy could get much better on this dataset.\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nfig = draw_line(p2.w, -2, 2)\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\nplt.ylim([-3.5,3.5])\n\n(-3.5, 3.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 3: Data with More than 2 Features\nFor the last experiment we see if the perceptron can classify data with more than two features. I generated a dataset of 100 points, still with binary labels, but this time each data point has five features.\n\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 100, n_features = 5, centers = 2)\n\nNow when we fit our perceptron and print the weights we get a six element vector, where the first five values correspond to the features and the final value corresponds to the bias. Our perceptron generalizes to data with more than two features!\n\np3 = Perceptron()\np3.fit(X,y,max_steps = 1000)\np3.w\n\narray([ 2.02291666,  6.08425872,  0.74441411,  5.17387787, 10.87406143,\n       -1.69055338])\n\n\nWhen we plot and print the accuracy of our perceptron we see that we achieve a loss of 1.0. This suggests that the dataset I generated is linearly separable.\n\nfig = plt.plot(p3.history)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Iteration\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Accuracy\")\n\n\n\n\n\np3.score(X,y)\n\n1.0"

    "text": "Runtime of the Perceptron Update\nEach perceptron update (see Equation 1) is performed on only one data point, so the runtime of a single update is independent of the number of data points in the provided dataset. Performing the dot product \\(\\langle\\mathbf{\\tilde{w}}^{(t)}\\mathbf{,\\tilde{x}}_i\\rangle\\) requires p+1 multiplications and p additions, for a runtime of O(p) (where p = number of features). The remaining operations within the expression \\(\\mathbb{1}(y_i\\langle\\mathbf{\\tilde{w}}^{(t)}\\mathbf{,\\tilde{x}}_i\\rangle<0)\\) are scalar multiplication or boolean comparison, so the total runtime of this expression is O(p), dominated by the dot product. This expression produces a scalar which is multiplied by \\(y_i\\), another scalar, and \\(\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_i\\), which has dimensions (p+1)x1. Multiplying two scalars by a vector with dimensions (p+1)x1 takes O(p) time, so the runtime of \\(\\mathbb{1}(y_i\\langle\\mathbf{\\tilde{w}}^{(t)}\\mathbf{,\\tilde{x}}_i\\rangle<0)y_i\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_i\\) is O(p+p). The result of this expression is then added to the prior weight vector, which requires p+1 additions. Thus the total runtime of the update is O(p+p+p) = O(3p), which simplifies to O(p), a linear runtime determined by the number of features."

The syntax for writing math is very similar to the syntax used in the \\(\\LaTeX\\) markup language. For example, $f(x) \\approx y$ renders to \\(f(x) \\approx y\\). To place complex mathematical expressions on their own lines, use double dollar signs. For example, the expression\n$$\\mathcal{L}(a, b) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n (ax_i + b - y_i)^2$$\nrenders to:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}(a, b) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n (ax_i + b - y_i)^2\\;.\\]\nBehind the scenes, math is powered by the MathJax engine.
